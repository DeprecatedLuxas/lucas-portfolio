import { PackageManager } from "~/components/PackageManager.tsx";

<h1 class="text-4xl text-center">Import Cost</h1>

<p>
Import Cost is using the extremely fast bundler [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to calculate the size of your imports.

But because ESBuild is a native bundler, we can't ship it with the extension.

</p>

So to fix this issue, you will need to install it yourself.

<PackageManager pkg="esbuild" client:load />
