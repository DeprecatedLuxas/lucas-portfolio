<p>
Import Cost is using the extremely fast bundler [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to calculate the size of your imports.
<br/>
But because ESBuild is a native bundler, we can't ship it with the extension.
So to fix this issue, you will need to install it yourself.

<PackageManager client:load packageManagers={["npm"]} />
